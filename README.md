## 👨🏻‍💻 About

The project aims to transform an Excel spreadsheet used for sizing sterilization equipment in hospitals into an interactive online tool that can capture qualified leads and map future clients, while handling the collection and integration of data on hospitals under construction in Brazil.

I developed a Web Administrative Portal to provide more precise and clear information about client registrations, thus mapping future clients and obtaining information about new hospitals under construction.
